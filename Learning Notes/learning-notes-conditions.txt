- Code in Components

LOOPING:
🔑 Always use a key
- Better than using index if you have real IDs:
{users.map(user => (
  <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />
))}

Keys help React:
- track items between renders
- avoid weird UI bugs
- improve performance

🚫 Avoid using array index as key when:
- list can reorder
- items can be added/removed
- list is dynamic

🧠 Conditional looping:
{
    products
    .filter(p => p.inStock)
    .map(p => (
        <Product key={p.id} product={p} />
    ))
}

Inline version:
{items.length === 0 && <p>No items found</p>}

⚠️ What NOT to do

❌ Traditional for loops in JSX
❌ Mutating arrays (push, splice) during render
❌ Forgetting key
❌ Doing heavy loops directly in JSX

⚡ Performance tip (big lists)
- If your list is large:
- use useMemo to memoize the mapped result
- or use virtualization (like react-window)

const renderedItems = useMemo(
  () => items.map(i => <Item key={i.id} item={i} />),
  [items]
);

🧩 Rule of thumb

In React:
- loop with map
- render components
- give them stable keys
- keep logic OUT of JSX when it gets complex
